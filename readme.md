# Neural Machine Translation

This repo is meant for learning and illustrative purposes. It builds deep netural machine translation models from scratch.

Currently implemented architectures:
- Encoder-Decoder LSTM with Attention
- Encoder-Decoder Transformer

Transformer models come in different versions improving sequentially.

Up next:
- Export the best model to the ONNX format and deploy it to a web app
